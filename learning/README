Installation
============

The program itself does not require any installation step, it is just a matter
of running it provided that all the dependencies are installed. 


Dependencies:
=============

- numpy ( http://scipy.org/Download )
- scikit-learn ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html )
- pyyaml ( http://pyyaml.org/ )


Running:
========

The program takes only one input parameter, the configuration file. For 
example:

python src/learn_model.py config/svr.yaml


Configuration file:
===================

The configuration uses the YAML format (http://www.yaml.org/). Its layout is 
quite straightforward. It is formed by key and value pairs that map directly
to dictionaries (in Python) or hash tables with string keys. One example is 
as follows:

learning: 
    method: LassoLars
    parameters:
        alpha: 1.0
        max_iter: 500
        normalize: True   
        fit_intercept: True
        fit_path: True
        verbose: False

Each keyword followed by a ":" represents an entry in a hash. In this example,
the dictionary contains an entry "learning" that points to another dictionary
with two entries "method" and "parameters". The values of each entry can be
lists, dictionaries or primitive values like floats, integers, booleans or strings.
Please note that each level in the example above is indented with 4 spaces.
